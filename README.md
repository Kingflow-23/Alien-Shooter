# First-Person Shooter Game

A Unity-based first-person shooter that blends fast-paced combat with interactive systems and immersive effects.

---

## üéØ Overview

This project features both projectile and hitscan mechanics (projectiles are currently used exclusively), with support for shotguns and pellet spread. Players can switch among six weapons‚Äîsniper, regular gun, shotgun, rifle1, rifle2, and rifle3‚Äîvia number keys or the scroll wheel. Each weapon carries its own data (fire rate, damage, projectile force) and a unique firing sound.

Enemies spawn dynamically around the player within a set radius, up to a configurable limit. There are four distinct enemy types, each varying in speed, size, health, damage, and score value. A real-time kill counter tracks progress. Once the player reaches the target kill count (default 20), a hidden goal object is activated at a random location. The game is won by destroying or reaching this goal.

Health pickups spawn randomly to help the player recover. Bullet impacts generate a temporary visual effect‚Äîoriginally envisioned as a black hole‚Äîthat disappears after a few seconds when hitting enemies, the ground, or the goal. Ambient snow effects and a clean overlay-based UI display health, win/lose messages, and restart controls. Audio is managed by a centralized `AudioManager` singleton, handling background music, weapon SFX, and monster attack noises, with the main theme playing at startup.
